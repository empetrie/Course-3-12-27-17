The R script in this repo takes the raw data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and performs the following steps:
  1. combines numeric data with subject and activity IDs
  2. merges testing and traing data sets together 
  3. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
  4. maps activity labels onto the dataset to replace nuemric IDs
  5. maps variable names onto the raw data
  6. creates a separate dataset with only averages for each variable
